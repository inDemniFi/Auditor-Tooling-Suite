# Auditor Tooling Suite

Welcome to the Auditor Tooling Suite repository. This repository serves as a resource for ranking auditors based on their tooling suite for auditing cryptocurrency protocols. The Auditor Tooling Suite is an essential part of our comprehensive auditor ranking process.

## Introduction

The Auditor Tooling Suite is a collection of tools used by auditors to assess the security of crypto projects. This repository provides a matrix that ranks different tool categories within the suite. It is important to note that the Auditor Tooling Suite is only one aspect of our overall auditor ranking process. As we continue to develop and expand this project, we will be adding more resources to enhance the auditor ranking process.


## Auditor Tooling Suite Matrix

The matrix below outlines the ranking and utilization of different tool categories within the Auditor Tooling Suite:


The row with the numbers is ranking the tools and usage of the tools together from 1-10. Just manually reviewing the code is a 1, and below are the vulnerabilities that should be discovered through manual review. As you use more tools and combine them with other tools, you can discover more vulnerabilities. A 1 is functional testing of the smart contract, but a 10 is system testing which would be equivalent to auditing the expected usage of the defi stack of that protocol. As you can see, this is mostly conceptual right now, though with your help, we can improve the Auditor Tooling Suite Matrix to better and transparently review crypto auditors.
