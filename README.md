# Auditor Tooling Suite

Welcome to the Auditor Tooling Suite repository. This repository serves as a resource for ranking auditors based on their tooling suite for auditing cryptocurrency protocols. The Auditor Tooling Suite is an essential part of our comprehensive auditor ranking process.

## Introduction

The Auditor Tooling Suite is a collection of tools used by auditors to assess the security of crypto projects. This repository provides a matrix that ranks different tool categories within the suite. It is important to note that the Auditor Tooling Suite is only one aspect of our overall auditor ranking process. As we continue to develop and expand this project, we will be adding more resources to enhance the auditor ranking process.

## Usage

To access the Auditor Tooling Suite matrix and learn more about the tool categories and their rankings, please refer to the [Auditor Tooling Suite Matrix](#auditor-tooling-suite-matrix) section below.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community to improve and enhance the Auditor Tooling Suite repository. If you have suggestions, bug reports, or would like to contribute new features or tool categories, please feel free to submit a pull request. Together, we can make the auditor ranking process more comprehensive and valuable for the crypto community.
